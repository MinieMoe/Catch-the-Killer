# Catch-the-Killer

My very first game that I created for my final project in CS 105 at Central Washington University in 2020.
After taking this class, I decided to switch from Business to Computer Science. I really enjoyed working on this project even though I was quite new to coding.

"Cath the Killer" was inspired by Five Nights at Freddy's. I had to simplified to match my coding level at that moment. During that process, it came to me how we could make a game captivating even though it was just a simple gameplay.
